For this problem, I used a graph representing the whole feild with each node being an x,y coordinate and being connected to every adjacent node.
I used the path scoring methods provided to give each edge a weight representing the risk. I also gave each edge a weight of either 1 or 1.41 depending 
on if it was a vertical/horizontal or diagonal edge. Finally, I created a dijkstras algorithm implementation and ran it twice, once focusing on
minimizing risk using length as a tiebreaker, and once focusing on minimizing length using risk as a tiebreaker. This way, any node that was visited
by the first dijkstras run had the shortest risk minimizing path, and any node that wasnt visited was too far away to focus on risk, so I had to focus on
length instead using the second dijkstras run.
